# Advanced-Network-Design
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of an advanced network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is modeled for a corporate or educational environment that spans multiple branches and includes efficient configurations for VLANs, routing, and tunneling.

# Advanced Network Design with Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Overview
This project showcases the design of a complex network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is tailored for a corporate or educational environment, demonstrating advanced configurations such as VLANs, routing, and tunneling.

## Features
- **Routers**: Multiple routers connected via Serial and Gigabit Ethernet ports for inter-network communication.
- **Switches**: VLAN configurations to optimize network performance and enhance security.
- **End Devices**: PCs connected within VLANs to simulate user environments.
- **Servers**: Configured for network services such as:
  - **DHCP**: For automated IP address assignment.
  - **DNS**: For domain name resolution.

## Goals
1. Simulate a real-world networking environment.
2. Enhance understanding of VLANs, routing protocols, and tunneling.
3. Demonstrate efficient network design for scalability and security.
